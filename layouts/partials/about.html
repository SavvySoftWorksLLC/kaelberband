        On December 10th, 1999 at 7:30 PM in Santa Cruz, California, the bassist for Kaelber, Tabor McLeod, was born.  Two hours later and 2,700 miles away in Morgantown, WV, lead guitarist/lead singer for Kaelber, Noah Myers, was born.  Who would have guessed that 15 years later these two would meet and form the nucleus of Kaelber. During the summer of 2016, the addition of Matt Reese on drums was the final piece to Kaelber and sealed the band's hard driving, yet fluid sound.

        Kaelber is an up and coming band that has been building a steady buzz in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas since their first show in 2015.  Based out of Greensburg, PA, Kaelber combines an eclectic mix of psychedelic, alternative, progressive, and pop rock fused with punk, funk, and metal to create a truly unique sound.  Kaelber's onstage energy is infectious as they showcase their original songs and play covers from influences such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jimi Hendrix.
